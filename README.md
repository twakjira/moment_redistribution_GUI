## Introduction

This is a Python-based application that predicts the moment redistribution for Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) reinforced concrete beams using a hybrid Machine Learning (ML) model. The application uses the PySimpleGUI library for a user-friendly graphical user interface. It takes various input parameters from the user, such as the gross area, concrete compressive strength, longitudinal reinforcement type, and stirrups type, among others. The model then outputs the moment redistribution percentage based on the given input parameters.

## Requirements

To use this application, you must have the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3.6 or higher
    PySimpleGUI
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Pillow (PIL)
    openpyxl
    pickle
    
You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install pysimplegui numpy pandas pillow openpyxl pickle5

## How to Use

    Clone or download the repository.
    Navigate to the directory containing the Python script and the dataset.
    Run the Python script: Moment_redistribution_GUI.py
