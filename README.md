# moment_redistribution_GUI

Introduction

This is a Python-based application that predicts the moment redistribution for Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) reinforced concrete beams using a hybrid Machine Learning (ML) model. The application uses the PySimpleGUI library for a user-friendly graphical user interface. It takes various input parameters from the user, such as the gross area, concrete compressive strength, longitudinal reinforcement type, and stirrups type, among others. The model then outputs the moment redistribution percentage based on the given input parameters.

    Python 3.6 or higher
    PySimpleGUI
    NumPy
    Pandas
